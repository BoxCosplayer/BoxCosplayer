## Hello 👋👋

My name is Rajveer, an aspiring Security engineer / Quantum algorithms engineer based in the UK.
I currently work on quantum optimisation algorithms for A*STAR's Institute of High Performance Computing, and in my previous roles I have designed & built a multitude of secure-by-design software as well as a variety of inhouse cyber security tools.

## My Projects

The projects on my profile cover all of my personal endeavours, typically utilities I'd rather build myself than download from other sources!

This includes (but is not limited to):

go-search-engine - Born out of a frustration of searching for my links through a sea of bookmarks, I created a shortcut engine that transforms simple keywords into redirects to your favourite links, so you only need to remember _where_ to go, not just where the bookmark is!

subject-recommender - This utility software provides a way for students to decide _what_ to study rather than when and for how long. It does this by intaking and analysing your grade history and provides outputs catered to you!

goatpad [WIP] - A notepad alternative, with IDE elements planned. A text editor built using go, from scratch.

Powered-Learning [WIP] - A front-end of sorts for my subject-recommender, wrapping it with a lot of very useful features! I plan to deploy this website publicly once it is complete.

## About me
