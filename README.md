## Hello 👋👋

My name is Rajveer, an aspiring Security engineer based in the UK.
I currently work on quantum optimisation algorithms for A*STAR's IHPC, and in my previous roles I have designed & built loads of secure-by-design software as well as a variety of inhouse cyber security tools.

## My Projects

go-search-engine - Keywork -> links redirect engine.
goatpad / go-language-server - A vim-like text editor that lives in the terminal, developed alongside a language server for go, built using c++.
subject-recommender - This utility software provides a way for students to decide _what_ to study rather than when and for how long.
Powered-Learning - A frontend for my subject-recommender.
