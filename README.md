## Hello 👋👋

My name is Rajveer, an aspiring Security engineer / Quantum algorithms engineer based in the UK.
I currently work on quantum optimisation algorithms for A*STAR's Institute of High Performance Computing, and in my previous roles I have designed & built secure-by-design software as well as a variety of inhouse cyber security tools.

## My Projects

The project on my profile cover all of my personal endeavours, typically utilities I'd rather build myself than download from other sources!

This includes (but is not limited to!):

go-search-engine - Born out of a frustration of searching for my links through a sea of bookmarks, I created a shortcut engine that transforms simple keywords into redirects to your favourite links, so you only need to remember _where_ to go, not just where the bookmark is!

subject-recommender - This utility software provides a way for students to decide _what_ to study rather than when and for how long. It does this by intaking and analysing your grade history and provides outputs catered to you!

goatpad [WIP] - My next project I will emark on once my go learning journey is nearing its midpoint, and once the final features to my other projects are completed. 
                It will be a windows notepad alternative.

Powered-Learning [WIP] - A front-end of sorts for my subject-recommender, wrapping it with a lot of very useful features! I plan to deploy this website publicly once it is complete.

## About me

- I am currently studying BSc Cyber Security at the University of Warwick, due to gradute in 2027
- I am in Singapore for a paid placement to work on behalf of A*STAR as a research intern (Statistical Research Officer)
- I am reading one book/month for the whole year, starting from May 25 - May 26!
